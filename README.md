# Veteran-Tech-Transition-Hub
## Project Proposal
Two-page website prototype for newly separated honorable veterans who look to transition from their military career into tech. This prototype website is a rough visual of what the proposed website should look like and how it should operate. This proposed website is intended to be a resource for all veterans, though it is mostly catered to veterans who are particularly interested in tech careers. Veterans uninterested in tech will still benefit from the resources provided by this website.
## Repository Purpose
This repository will contain the projects scope, the project plan, project expectations, project risk analysis, project exclusions, and the live website prototype in one organized workspace. 

## Live Prototype
Please note: The prototype website is not intended to be a fully operational and polished website, it's only meant to aid in the projects proposal.
